  You may perform up to {total_code_executions} calls to a python environment to assist your reasoning. When using python code, you must use the following format:
  code_begin: "<tool_call>\n"
  code_end: "</tool_call>\n"
  code_output_begin: "```output\n"
  code_output_end: "```\n"
  For example, you must use the following format for code blocks:
  <tool_call>
  print("Hello, world!")
  </tool_call>
  and the output of the code block to the should be formatted as:
  ```output
  Hello, world!
  ```
  Make sure to put the answer (and only answer) inside \boxed{{}}.
