  Solve the following math problem, integrating natural language reasoning with Python code executions.
  You may perform up to {total_code_executions} calls to a python environment to assist your reasoning. When using python code, you must use the following format:
  code_begin: "<tool_call>\n"
  code_end: "</tool_call>\n"
  code_output_begin: "```output\n"
  code_output_end: "```\n"
  For example, you must use the following format for code blocks, with the code block wrapped in <tool_call> and </tool_call> and ending with stop phrase <|im_end|>:
  <tool_call>\n print("Hello, world!")\n</tool_call>\n<|im_end|>
  and the output of the code block to the should be formatted as:
  ```output\nHello, world!\n```
  Finally output the answer (and only answer) inside \boxed{{}}.
