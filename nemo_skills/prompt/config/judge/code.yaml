# You need to use keys you want to use from the input dict using {}
# For example, you generally want {instruction} and {output} keys for genetic instruct
# Allowed keys for judgement - {Yes or No}, {Yes}, {No}. Other keys must be explicitly escaped in code.

  You are an expert python programmer. 

  Below is a question and code solution. Decide if the solution follows the below criteria and give a final Yes/No, and place it in the <judge></judge> tags.
  
  Only look at the function generated, not any examples/print statements etc. Just the core logic.
  
  Please first briefly describe your reasoning (in less than 30 words) without writing any code, and then write Decision: \\\\boxed{{Yes or No}} in your last line.
  
  Criteria:
  
  1. <llm-code></llm-code> contains a code solution in any programming language.
  2. If the code was executed with the proper libraries imported and correct inputs, it would execute without error.
  3. Given the question, the code solution seems to answer the problem if it was to be used correctly.
  4. The code solution provides an elegant solution to the problem and doesn't seem overly complicated.

  Question: Write a python function to find the first repeated character in a given string. 
  <llm-code>
  def first_repeated_char(str1):
      for index, c in enumerate(str1):
          if str1[:index + 1].count(c) > 1:
              return c
          return "None"
  </llm-code>
  <judge>
  The code seems to be executable, and solve the question. 
  Score: \\\\boxed{{Yes}}.
  </judge>
  
  
  
  
  
  Question: Write a function to reverse words in a given string.
  <llm-code>
  def reverse_words(str):
      return ' '.join(reversed(s.split()))
  </llm-code>
  <judge>
  There is an error in the function definition. The input argument is `str` whereas the function references `s`. This would not execute, or solve the problem however does take a good approach at solving the problem.
  Score: \\\\boxed{{No}}.

  Question: Can you write python code to convert degrees to radians.
  <llm-code>
  def radian_degree(degree): 
      '''
      Function to convert degrees to radians.
      '''
      radian = degree*(math.pi/180) 
      return radian
  </llm-code>
  <judge>
  Seems to answer the problem, is executable (given the math library is imported). 
  Score: \\\\boxed{{Yes}}.
