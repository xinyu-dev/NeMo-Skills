    You will be given a fragment of a solution to a math problem that includes a Python code block.
    Your task is to evaluate the significance of this Python code in solving the math problem.
    In your assessment, you MUST follow these guidelines:

    1. Classification:
    Evaluate the significance of the code's contribution by categorizing it into one of three levels:

    - Trivial: The code performs calculations that could easily be done manually without significant effort (e.g., solving simple equations, doing arithmetic, applying formulas to known variables). The code usage provides no meaningful or minor advantage over manual calculation.

    - Moderate: The code performs calculations that would be tedious, error-prone, or time-consuming to do manually, but still technically possible (e.g., matrix operations, numerical integration of standard functions, solving systems of equations). The code usage provides efficiency but isn't essential.

    - Significant: The code performs calculations that would be practically impossible or extremely difficult to do manually (e.g., brute-forcing combinatorial problems, complex simulations, solving complex differential equations, high-dimensional optimization). The code usage creates a crucial shortcut that fundamentally enables the solution.

    2. Output Format:
    - Your response MUST follow this exact format (without extra commentary or text):
        ```
        Reasoning: <a couple of sentences explaining your rationale>
        Significance: <Trivial, Moderate, or Significant>
        ```

    Let's find the roots of the quadratic equation: 3x² - 5x + 2 = 0

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq

    x = symbols('x')
    equation = 3*x**2 - 5*x + 2
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    print(solutions)
    ```
    ```output
    [2/3, 1]
    ```

    So the solutions are x = 2/3 and x = 1.
    """
    ```
    Reasoning: This code simply solves a basic quadratic equation that could easily be solved manually using the quadratic formula or factoring. Finding roots of a quadratic equation with small integer coefficients is a standard calculation that requires minimal effort by hand.
    Significance: Trivial

    To solve this system of 4 linear equations with 4 unknowns:

    y = 2.7

    Reasoning: This code solves a system of 4 linear equations with 4 unknowns. While this could be solved manually using Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule, it would be tedious and error-prone. The system is complex enough that computational assistance provides significant efficiency but doesn't enable something impossible.

    Reasoning: This code finds all integer solutions to a Diophantine equation by iterating through possible values of x and calculating the corresponding y.

    Reasoning: This code calculates a probability using the binomial distribution formula. While the calculation involves combinations and powers, the mathematical concept is straightforward and could be calculated manually by explicitly writing and reducing the terms. The code provides a minor computational convenience but doesn't fundamentally change the nature of the solution process, making it a trivial use of Python code.

    **REMINDER**
    When evaluating significance, consider:
    1. Could this calculation reasonably be done by hand? If yes, how difficult would it be?
    2. Does the code enable a solution approach that would otherwise be impractical?
    3. Is the computational advantage merely convenience, or is it essential to the solution?

    Remember to classify as Trivial, Moderate, or Significant based on these considerations.
