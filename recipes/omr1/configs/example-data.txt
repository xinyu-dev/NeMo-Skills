Prove that the sum of all these vectors is zero.  (A magic square is a square matrix such that the sums of entries in all its rows and columns are equal.)", "forum_discussions": "Post 1:\nWell, first, let us make some notations . If x is a real number, then \r\nsgn(x) is -1 if x<0, 0 if x=0 and +1 if x>0 (the signum function). Also denote by a<sub>xy</sub> the value in the square having coordinates (x,y), with 1<=x<=n, 1<=y<=n . If we let [b]i[/b] and [b]j[/b] be the versors of the axis of coordinates (vectors of length 1,forming an orthogonal basis of R^2) ,and we take the axis parallel to the sides of the squares, then the sum of the vectors is 0 is equivalent to the following condition :\r\n\r\n1/2 * \\sum sgn(a<sub>xy</sub> - a<sub>x'y'</sub>) [(x-x')[b]i[/b]  + (y-y')[b]j[/b]]=0 (*)\r\n\r\nwhere the sum above is taken over all pairs (x,y) different from (x',y') . There is an 1/2 because we count each vector twice.\r\n\r\nNow, it is enough the show that by projecting the relation (*) on one of the axis it holds, and then analogously we will prove it for the other axis and we are done . Thus we have to prove :\r\n\r\n1/2 * \\sum sgn(a<sub>xy</sub> - a<sub>x'y'</sub>) (x-x') = 0  <=> \\sum sgn(a<sub>xy</sub> - a<sub>x'y'</sub>)x = \\sum sgn(a<sub>xy</sub> - a<sub>x'y'</sub>)x'  (**)\r\n\r\nBoth of the sums above are taken over all pairs (x,y) different from (x',y').\r\n\r\nLet A be the LHS of (**) and B the RHS . Let's compute A :\r\nFor each fixed (x,y) there are exactly n^2 - a<sub>xy</sub> pairs (x',y') with a<sub>x'y'</sub> > a<sub>xy</sub> (think about it!) and a<sub>xy</sub>-1 pairs with a<sub>x'y'</sub> < a<sub>xy</sub> . Thus :\r\n\r\nA = \\sum (n^2 - a<sub>xy</sub>)x - \\sum (a<sub>xy</sub> - 1)x = \\sum (n^2 - 2 a<sub>xy</sub> +1)x\r\n\r\nThe sums above are taken over all pairs (x,y).\r\n\r\nNow, because it's a magic square the sum on every row/column is equal to (1 + 2 + .. + n^2)/n = n(n^2+1)/2 .\r\n\r\nNow re-write A as follows :\r\n\r\nA = (n^2+1) \\sum x - 2 \\sum x*a<sub>xy</sub> = (n^2+1) * [n(1+2+..+n)] - 2 \\sum x*a<sub>xy</sub> = (here take into account that it's a magic square!) =  (n^2+1)*n^2(n+1)/2 - 2(1+2+..+n)* n(n^2+1)/2 = 0 !!!\r\n\r\nFirst, again in all the summations above we sum over all pairs (x,y) . For the x * a<sub>xy</sub> part, for *each distinct value of x*, which can be 1,2,..,n, we multiply with a_x1 + a_x2 + .. + a_xn which is nothing but the sum on a row or column (depends on how you take the axis!) . The rest of the summation is trivial.\r\n\r\nNow, getting back to B it can be computed exactly in the same manner.I hope I didn't make a mistake in the calculations and even if I did,it's the same idea for the correct proof ... (I'm kind of in a hurry now so I don't really care about getting the numbers right) :D \r\n\r\nI would be interested in a more 'combinatorial' proof, since at first glance the problem is hopeless by using any kind of calculations ! Still, if my soln is correct I proved this fact wrong :P\r\n\r\nHey, could you please post the subjects of INMO 2003 in here ? And how did u perform in the olympiad ? Thanx\r\n\r\nLater !\n\nPost 2:\nNote: We must have that n divides n(n+1)(2n+1)/6, so (n+1)(2n+1) must be divisible by 6, but if they are not, this is vacuously true anyway.  \n\nAn easier solution would be to think of a torus.  That is, pretend that the leftmost column is just to the right of the rightmost column, and consider that if we draw these arrows, the horizontal sum is 0, because as we go from $a_1$,... to $a_n$ across, the number we are at minus the magnitude of the sums of the vectors to the right is always $a_1$.  Then if we add these sums, we get a result of 0.;  Yet these sums total the sum of the rightmost column minus that of the leftmost, which is also 0, so the sum of all the horizontal vectors is 0(n)-0=0, and similarly so is the sum of the vertical vectors.\n\n:)\n\nEDIT: iandrei said that he wanted to see a combinatorial proof.  This is mine.\n\nPost 3:\nCan someone check this proof? I couldn't read the ones above\n\nWe only work in the horizontal direction and prove that the sum of the vector projections is zero, and the proof for the vertical direction is the same.\nSo label the columns from $1$ to $n$. If a vector goes from column $i$ to $j$ we will give it the integer value $j-i$, and consider the sum of all these values taken over all vectors in the magic square. If we consider column $k$, which has numbers $a_1<a_2...<a_n$ Then the number of vectors with their tail at column $k$ (this will contribute $-k$ to the sum of the value of the vectors) is equal to $n^2 - a_n + n^2-a_{n-1} - 1+ ... +n^2 - a_1 - (n-1)$. On the other hand, the number of vectors with their head at column $k$ is $a_1 - 1 + a_2-2... +a_n-n$ (and each of these contributes $+k$ to the sum of the values of the vectors) Using $a_1+a_2+...+a_n = \\frac{n^3+n}{2}$, we get that these are equal, so each column contributes $0$ to the sum of the vectors. If we sum over all columns we find that the entire vector sum will be $0$, and repeating for the vertical direction gives the desired result."}
