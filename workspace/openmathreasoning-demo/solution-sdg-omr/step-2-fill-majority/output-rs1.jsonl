If we let [b]i[/b] and [b]j[/b] be the versors of the axis of coordinates (vectors of length 1,forming an orthogonal basis of R^2) ,and we take the axis parallel to the sides of the squares, then the sum of the vectors is 0 is equivalent to the following condition :\r\n\r\n1/2 * \\sum sgn(a<sub>xy</sub> - a<sub>x'y'</sub>) [(x-x')[b]i[/b]  + (y-y')[b]j[/b]]=0 (*)\r\n\r\nwhere the sum above is taken over all pairs (x,y) different from (x',y') .

That is, pretend that the leftmost column is just to the right of the rightmost column, and consider that if we draw these arrows, the horizontal sum is 0, because as we go from $a_1$,... to $a_n$ across, the number we are at minus the magnitude of the sums of the vectors to the right is always $a_1$.  Then if we add these sums, we get a result of 0.;  Yet these sums total the sum of the rightmost column minus that of the leftmost, which is also 0, so the sum of all the horizontal vectors is 0(n)-0=0, and similarly so is the sum of the vertical vectors.\n\n:)\n\nEDIT: iandrei said that he wanted to see a combinatorial proof.  This is mine.\n\nPost 3:\nCan someone check this proof? I couldn't read the ones above\n\nWe only work in the horizontal direction and prove that the sum of the vector projections is zero, and the proof for the vertical direction is the same.\nSo label the columns from $1$ to $n$. If a vector goes from column $i$ to $j$ we will give it the integer value $j-i$, and consider the sum of all these values taken over all vectors in the magic square. If we consider column $k$, which has numbers $a_1<a_2...<a_n$ Then the number of vectors with their tail at column $k$ (this will contribute $-k$ to the sum of the value of the vectors) is equal to $n^2 - a_n + n^2-a_{n-1} - 1+ ... +n^2 - a_1 - (n-1)$. On the other hand, the number of vectors with their head at column $k$ is $a_1 - 1 + a_2-2... +a_n-n$ (and each of these contributes $+k$ to the sum of the values of the vectors) Using $a_1+a_2+...+a_n = \\frac{n^3+n}{2}$, we get that these are equal, so each column contributes $0$ to the sum of the vectors. If we sum over all columns we find that the entire vector sum will be $0$, and repeating for the vertical direction gives the desired result.", "problem_extraction_gen": "Problem 1: In a magic square of size $n \\times n$ composed of the numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, n^2$, prove that the sum of the vectors joining the centers of any two squares, directed from the smaller number to the larger number, is zero.", "extracted_problem_idx": 0, "classify_proof_gen": "proof", "expected_answer": "4", "original_problem": "In a magic square of size $n \\times n$ composed of the numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, n^2$, prove that the sum of the vectors joining the centers of any two squares, directed from the smaller number to the larger number, is zero.", "problem": "Consider a magic square of size $n \\times n$ composed of the numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, n^2$.

Let's analyze this mathematically:\n\n- The product of three consecutive integers is always divisible by 2 and 3 (since among any three consecutive numbers, one is divisible by 2 and one is divisible by 3).\n- Therefore, for the product to be a prime number, two of the numbers would have to be either 1 or \\(-1\\), which isn\u2019t possible for three distinct consecutive integers, or at least one of the factors must be 1, so that the product simply equals the other two multiplied, both being consecutive and nonzero.\n\nLet\u2019s explicitly check for \\(n-1 = 1\\), \\(n = 1\\), or \\(n+1 = 1\\):\n\n- \\(n-1 = 1 \\implies n = 2: (1)\\cdot(2)\\cdot(3) = 6\\)\n- \\(n = 1: (0)\\cdot(1)\\cdot(2) = 0\\) (zero, not prime)\n- \\(n+1 = 1 \\implies n = 0: (-1)\\cdot(0)\\cdot(1) = 0\\)\n- \\(n-1 = -1 \\implies n = 0: (-1)\\cdot(0)\\cdot(1) = 0\\)\n- \\(n = -1: (-2)\\cdot(-1)\\cdot(0) = 0\\)\n- \\(n+1 = -1 \\implies n = -2: (-3)\\cdot(-2)\\cdot(-1) = -6\\)\n\nNone of these are prime. Let's try further out. Maybe for some small large values, it can work. But we see that the product is always divisible by 6 (as shown above: divisible by both 2 and 3), so the only possible way for the product to be prime is the product to be 6 itself.\n\nIs 6 a prime? No. Also, for negative values, we cannot get a positive prime.\n\nThus, based on code output and this line of reasoning, we see that it is **not possible** for the product of three consecutive integers to be a positive prime number.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{\\text{There are no such integers } a, b, c}", "forum_post": "[color=cyan]1.
