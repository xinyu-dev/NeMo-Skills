Also denote by a<sub>xy</sub> the value in the square having coordinates (x,y), with 1<=x<=n, 1<=y<=n . If we let [b]i[/b] and [b]j[/b] be the versors of the axis of coordinates (vectors of length 1,forming an orthogonal basis of R^2) ,and we take the axis parallel to the sides of the squares, then the sum of the vectors is 0 is equivalent to the following condition :\r\n\r\n1/2 * \\sum sgn(a<sub>xy</sub> - a<sub>x'y'</sub>) [(x-x')[b]i[/b]  + (y-y')[b]j[/b]]=0 (*)\r\n\r\nwhere the sum above is taken over all pairs (x,y) different from (x',y') . There is an 1/2 because we count each vector twice.\r\n\r\nNow, it is enough the show that by projecting the relation (*) on one of the axis it holds, and then analogously we will prove it for the other axis and we are done . Thus we have to prove :\r\n\r\n1/2 * \\sum sgn(a<sub>xy</sub> - a<sub>x'y'</sub>) (x-x') = 0  <=> \\sum sgn(a<sub>xy</sub> - a<sub>x'y'</sub>)x = \\sum sgn(a<sub>xy</sub> - a<sub>x'y'</sub>)x'  (**)\r\n\r\nBoth of the sums above are taken over all pairs (x,y) different from (x',y').\r\n\r\nLet A be the LHS of (**) and B the RHS .

That is, pretend that the leftmost column is just to the right of the rightmost column, and consider that if we draw these arrows, the horizontal sum is 0, because as we go from $a_1$,... to $a_n$ across, the number we are at minus the magnitude of the sums of the vectors to the right is always $a_1$.  Then if we add these sums, we get a result of 0.;  Yet these sums total the sum of the rightmost column minus that of the leftmost, which is also 0, so the sum of all the horizontal vectors is 0(n)-0=0, and similarly so is the sum of the vertical vectors.\n\n:)\n\nEDIT: iandrei said that he wanted to see a combinatorial proof.  This is mine.\n\nPost 3:\nCan someone check this proof? I couldn't read the ones above\n\nWe only work in the horizontal direction and prove that the sum of the vector projections is zero, and the proof for the vertical direction is the same.\nSo label the columns from $1$ to $n$. If a vector goes from column $i$ to $j$ we will give it the integer value $j-i$, and consider the sum of all these values taken over all vectors in the magic square. If we consider column $k$, which has numbers $a_1<a_2...<a_n$ Then the number of vectors with their tail at column $k$ (this will contribute $-k$ to the sum of the value of the vectors) is equal to $n^2 - a_n + n^2-a_{n-1} - 1+ ... +n^2 - a_1 - (n-1)$. On the other hand, the number of vectors with their head at column $k$ is $a_1 - 1 + a_2-2... +a_n-n$ (and each of these contributes $+k$ to the sum of the values of the vectors) Using $a_1+a_2+...+a_n = \\frac{n^3+n}{2}$, we get that these are equal, so each column contributes $0$ to the sum of the vectors. If we sum over all columns we find that the entire vector sum will be $0$, and repeating for the vertical direction gives the desired result.", "problem_extraction_gen": "Problem 1: In a magic square of size $n \\times n$ composed of the numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, n^2$, prove that the sum of the vectors joining the centers of any two squares, directed from the smaller number to the larger number, is zero.", "extracted_problem_idx": 0, "classify_proof_gen": "proof", "expected_answer": "4", "original_problem": "In a magic square of size $n \\times n$ composed of the numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, n^2$, prove that the sum of the vectors joining the centers of any two squares, directed from the smaller number to the larger number, is zero.", "problem": "Consider a magic square of size $n \\times n$ composed of the numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, n^2$.

The same goes for \\(B\\) to \\(E\\) along \\(BD\\).\n\nLet\u2019s try to express the area of each triangle in terms of these ratios.\n\nBut perhaps first, let's look for a direct relationship in ratios.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the areas as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Let } S_{ABE} = 18, ~ S_{CDE} = 32, ~ S_{BCE} = x, ~ S_{DAE} = y\n\\]\n\nThe four triangles \\(ABE\\), \\(BCE\\), \\(CDE\\), \\(DAE\\) together constitute the whole trapezoid.\n\nBut more, because of the way the diagonals intersect, we can use the property:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{ABE}{CDE} = \\frac{[AB]^2}{[CD]^2}\n\\]\n\nLet's check this property numerically, as it often is true for areas formed by intersecting diagonals in a trapezoid with parallel sides.\n\nLet\u2019s compute the ratio:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{ABE}{CDE} = \\frac{18}{32}\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s check if this leads us to deducing the area of \\(BCE\\).

Let's consider area as follows.\n\nLet the intersection point \\(E\\) divides \\(AC\\) in the ratio \\(m:n\\), meaning \\(AE : EC = m:n\\).\n\nSimilarly, on \\(BD\\), let \\(BE:ED = p:q\\).\n\nThe triangles share the same height from their base since their base is along the parallel sides.\n\nLet\u2019s be more explicit, using the areas and ratios.\n\nLet\u2019s check if a straightforward proportional rule connects the areas.\n\nBut perhaps it is easiest to assign variables to the points and compute the area of \\(BCE\\).\n\nLet\u2019s use the fact that the sum of the four triangle areas at \\(E\\) must equal the total area of the trapezoid, but that seems less direct because we have two unknowns left.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a system of equations involving the three triangle areas, given the geometry. Let's let the ratios be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{S_{ABE}}{S_{BCE}} = \\frac{AE}{EC}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{S_{CDE}}{S_{DAE}} = \\frac{CE}{EA}\n\\]\nGiven the total ratios sum to 1 along the diagonal, the sums of areas adjacent to A and C across E equal each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering mass-point geometry, the sum of the three areas forms a linear equation.\n\nBut perhaps it's faster to directly check the method with concrete computation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote \\(BE : ED = r : s\\), and try to express area \\(BCE\\) in terms of the given numbers.\n\nGiven the total, perhaps the sum of the three areas must equal that of the small triangle formed at \\(E\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is best attacked by algebra.\n\nLet\u2019s look for patterns numerically. Perhaps the sum \\(ABE + BCE =\\) total area above the parallel base, and \\(CDE + BCE\\) is that below.\n\nGiven constraints, perhaps let's try the method with area ratios.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate area ratios, assign area \\(x\\) to \\(BCE\\), and see if there's an easy relationship, perhaps via the harmonic mean.\n\nLet\u2019s numerically set up the proportion:\n\nLet\u2019s try to model the situation.
