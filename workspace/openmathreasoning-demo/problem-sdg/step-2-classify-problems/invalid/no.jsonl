Let P be a point in the interior of this triangle so that PA = 1, PB = 2 and PC = 3. Find the maximum area of the triangle ABC.][/color]\r\n\r\nBut I wanted to say that I found two very easy solutions, using a little calculus.\r\n\r\n[b]Solution     I[/b]\r\nConsider the area maximized for an angle X  with P in interior of angle A\r\nThe other Angle will be 60-X. Now write Cosine theorem with this angles,\r\nAnd u will get a quadratic equation. solve it for side B. Same way for finding side C. They will be only of cos(x) and sin(x) . Product BC must be maximized, derivates and that's it.\r\n\r\n[b]The second solution is based on analytic geom.[/b]\r\nTake A(0,0), C(0,cy) B(b,2*b).\r\nThe angle A will be 60 degs. Then let the maximized area be for a postition P(x,y) in the plane. Then x^2+y^2=1. Also, you can express \r\ncoords of B(b,2*b) with x&y, cause it will be the intersection of 2 circles.\r\nSame thing for C.\r\nBut we must maximize the area , so maximize the product of sides b & c.\r\nThen again Derivates and that's it :) :) :) :).\r\n\r\nI checked everything with maple, so really, derivates have only one zero,\r\neasy to find.\r\n\r\n[color=red][[b]Moderator edit:[/b] Generally, Romanian TST problems can be found at http://www.mathlinks.ro/Forum/resources.php?c=142&cid=26 ][/color]", "forum_discussions": "", "problem_extraction_gen": "Problem 1: Given a triangle ABC with angle BAC equal to 60\u00b0, and a point P inside the triangle such that PA = 1, PB = 2, and PC = 3, find the maximum area of triangle ABC.", "problem": "Given a triangle ABC with angle BAC equal to 60\u00b0, and a point P inside the triangle such that PA = 1, PB = 2, and PC = 3, find the maximum area of triangle ABC.", "extracted_problem_idx": 0, "classify_proof_gen": "not proof", "classify_mcq_gen": "not mcq", "classify_binary_gen": "not binary", "classify_invalid_gen": "not invalid"}
